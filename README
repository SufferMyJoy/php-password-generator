README

	This PHP Password Generator creates a randomly generated password from two randomly selected words from the
	Unix Dictionary file ("/usr/share/dict/words"). The script takes the two words, capitalizes their first letters, 
	and finally concatenates them together. The script then searches the combination word for certain characters. 
	If the script finds these characters, they are added to an array of valid characters. Once all the valid characters
	are found from the combination word, the array of valid characters is shuffled.
	
	The script then takes the first character from the valid characters array, which will be random thanks to the
	shuffle done to the array. The script then replaces every instance of the chosen valid character in the combination
	word with a number or symbol to increase the strength of the password. The mappings are as follows:
			
												A ===> 4
												E ===> 3
												I ===> 1
												O ===> 0
												U ===> Ü or ü depending on case
												G ===> 9
												S ===> $
												T ===> 7
												
	Once the particular character has been changed to its corresponding symbol or number, the password is returned. The
	passwords returned look like two english words that are perfectly readable (although granted some of the words in
	the Unix dictionary are not regularly used in everyday language).
	
	
INSTALLATION

	In order to install the script to your website, simply copy the PHP code contained in password-generator.php to
	whatever webpage you want it to on. Be sure to replace the "echo $password . "\n"" statement with code appropriate
	to your website. The comments in the file contain an example of HTML echo statements that look pretty good (in
	my opinion of course).
	
	The final piece to the installation is to of course transfer the word.list file to your server for the script to
	use. You can put this anywhere that the script has privileges to. For example, one a Wordpress installation, I
	usually put it under "wp-content/themes/YourTheme-Child/word.list". This may seem like a major security risk, but
	this whole password generator is open-source and the dictionary used is available to anyone with a Unix computer,
	and since Unix distributions are free, the dictionary file is free to anyone. Therefore, I see no point in hiding
	the file for any reason, the only harm that could come is if you for some reason gave writing access to the file
	and an attacker reduced the word list in order to make cracking passwords easier, so don't do that.
	
	The passwords have such a large degree of randomness in both the word selection and the character replacement
	scheme, that even with the dictionary file, it would take far too long to brute force a password.
	

CONTACT
	
	If you have any problems, concerns, or improvements, feel free to contact me at alex@dobsondev.com. Of course this
	project is available at Git Hub under https://github.com/SufferMyJoy/php-password-generator so feel free to branch
	this project and make any changes you want. One of the large improvements that could be made is making the word
	list only common words to help readability of the passwords generated.
