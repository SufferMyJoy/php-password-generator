PHP Password Generator

README

	This PHP Password Generator creates a randomly generated password from
	two randomly selected words from the Unix Dictionary file
	("/usr/share/dict/words"). The script takes the two words, capitalizes
	their first letters, and finally concatenates them together. The script
	then searches the combination word for certain characters. If the script
	finds these characters, they are added to an array of valid characters.
	Once all the valid characters are found from the combination word, the
	array of valid characters is shuffled. The script then takes the first
	character from the valid characters array, which will be random thanks to
	the shuffle done to the array. The script then replaces every instance of
	the chosen valid character in the combination word with a number or symbol
	to increase the strength of the password. The mappings are as follows:

												A ===> 4
												a ===> @
												E ===> 3
												e ===> 3
												I ===> 1
												i ===> 1
												O ===> 0
												o ===> 0
												U ===> Ü
												u ===> ü
												G ===> 9
												g ===> 9
												S ===> $
												s ===> 5
												T ===> 7
												t ===> 7

	There is also a 20% chance that the password generator will add an "!"
	to the end of the password, and another 20% chance that the generator
	will add a "#" to the front of the password. In the future it would be
	nice to have a feature which determines how secure the password has to
	be, and then scale the password with tricks such as these to increase
	the security.

	Once the particular character has been changed to its corresponding symbol
	or number, the password is returned. The passwords returned look like two
	english words that are perfectly readable (although granted some of the words
	in the Unix dictionary are not regularly used in everyday language).


INSTALLATION

	Copy the password-generator.php file as well as either the tiny-word.list or
	word.list file onto your server. From there you are free to call the password
	generator however you want. You can call it just as a single php call, or you
	can use AJAX in order to get as many passwords as you want over and over without
	reloading the page.

	The different between word.list and tiny-word.list is that word.list contains
	all the words found in the Unix dictionary file. tiny-word.list only contains
	words that are between 5 and 10 characters long. I found that tiny-word.list
	makes for better passwords, and the sizes are more predictable.


CONTACT

	If you have any problems, concerns, or improvements, feel free to contact me
	at alex@dobsondev.com. Of course this project is available at Git Hub under
	https://github.com/SufferMyJoy/php-password-generator so feel free to branch
   this project and make any changes you want. One of the large improvements
   that could be made is making the word list only common words to help
   readability of the passwords generated.
